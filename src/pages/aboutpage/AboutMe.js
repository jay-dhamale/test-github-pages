        Hey guys! I am Saloni Satpute and my journey of soap making started with
        a search for an all-comprehensive bathing soap that will not only be
        delightful to the eyes but also excellent in skin care and skin repair.
        I and my family have sensitive skin and the soaps available in the
        market did not match our expectations of a gentle yet aromatic soap.
        <br></br>
        <br /> So, I embarked on this journey of making my own natural bathing
        soaps. I gathered the knowledge about organic soap making and started
        trials of different soaps. After experimenting diligently for nearly two
        years, I was finally satisfied with my soaps! Several of my near and
        dear ones tried my soaps and were amazed about their novelty and instant
        skin-care results. Their positive impressions further fired my passion
        for soap making. I realized that I must extend this experience of
        bathing with my luxury soaps to our larger community!
        <br></br> <br />
        So here, I am offering 35 varieties of ‘Premium Luxury Bathing Soaps’
        that are not only very attractive and tempting but also gentle on your
        skin. I ensure to use all pure and real high-quality ingredients with
        natural essential oils and a natural soap base. As my brand name ‘Scents
        and Secret Soaps’ reveals, using these soaps would bring out the secret
        of healthy, glowing, and younger-looking skin. So experience my soaps
        and ‘Unleash the Beauty Within You’!
